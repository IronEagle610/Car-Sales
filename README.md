**Car Sales Regression Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (Car Sales Regression.ipynb) dedicated to performing regression analysis on a dataset of car sales. The objective is to predict the car purchase amount based on various features like customer demographics and financial information.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes the following features:

Age

Annual Salary

Credit Card Debt

Net Worth

**The target variable is:**

Car Purchase Amount

**Key Objectives**

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

Preprocess the dataset for machine learning (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).

Train a regression model to predict the car purchase amount.

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

**Technologies Used**

Python 3

Pandas for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for machine learning

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

**How to Use**

The notebook is divided into sections for ease of navigation:

Data Loading and Exploration

Data Preprocessing

Model Training

Model Evaluation

Conclusion

Execute the cells in order to reproduce the analysis and the model training process.
